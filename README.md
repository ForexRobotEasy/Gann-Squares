# Gann Squares ReadMe File

## Description

This ReadMe file provides information about the code for the Gann Squares indicator. The Gann Squares indicator is a custom indicator that plots Gann squares on the chart. Gann squares are a geometric tool used in technical analysis to identify key support and resistance levels in the market.

This code is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and is provided as a sample code that can be used to implement the Gann Squares indicator in MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform. ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product. To find the official developer of this product, please refer to MQL5.

## Product Description

Gann Squares is a powerful technical analysis tool that helps traders identify key support and resistance levels in the market. By plotting Gann squares on the chart, traders can visualize important price levels that may act as barriers to price movement.

This product provides a custom indicator called Gann Squares that can be added to the MT5 platform. The indicator takes three input parameters: Square1, Square2, and Square3, which represent the square numbers for the Gann squares to be plotted on the chart. The indicator calculates the Gann square values for each square number and plots them on the chart as lines. Additionally, it displays the square numbers in labels on the chart for easy reference.

To use this product, simply add the Gann Squares indicator to the chart and configure the input parameters as desired. The indicator will then plot the Gann squares on the chart, allowing traders to identify potential support and resistance levels.

## Code Explanation

The code is written in MQL5 and consists of three main sections: initialization, iteration, and a custom function to calculate Gann square values.

The initialization section (`OnInit()`) sets up the indicator buffers and creates labels to display the square numbers on the chart. It sets the indicator buffers using the `SetIndexStyle()` and `SetIndexBuffer()` functions. It also creates labels using the `ObjectCreate()` function and sets their properties using the `ObjectSetText()` and `ObjectSet()` functions.

The iteration section (`OnCalculate()`) calculates the Gann square values for each square number and stores them in the indicator buffers. It uses a `for` loop to iterate over the bars of the chart and calculates the square values using the `GannSquareValue()` function. The square values are then assigned to the indicator buffers using the `IndicatorBuffer()` function.

The custom function (`GannSquareValue()`) calculates the Gann square value for a given square number and index. It uses the square root of the square number and multiplies it by the index to calculate the square value. The square value is then returned.

Please note that this code is provided as a sample and may require further customization or modification to suit specific trading strategies or preferences.
